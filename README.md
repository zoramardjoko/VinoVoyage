# Motivation and Goals
Choosing the right bottle of wine can often be overwhelming, especially for those with limited knowledge about wine varieties and flavor profiles. The motivation behind this application stems from the desire to enhance the wine selection process for consumers by leveraging the vast amount of data available. We aim to streamline the wine selection process, allowing users to search by wine title and filter based on their desired price and points, and also find sommeliers to connect with on Twitter. Additionally, we aim to incorporate an educational component in our app, allowing users to learn more about wine. Overall, our application is designed to demystify the wine selection process, enrich the user's understanding of wine, and foster a more connected and informed community of wine enthusiasts.

# Application Functionality
Our app offers a user-friendly interface where consumers can easily search for wines by title and apply filters such as price range and rating points to narrow down their options to suit their preferences and budget. This feature is particularly useful for those seeking to explore new wines or to ensure they get the best value for their money. Users can also view top sommeliers, ranked by the number of wines they reviewed, and access the sommeliersâ€™ Twitter pages through links on our site. Additionally, we implemented a random wine recommender, as well as a wine trivia game.
